+ how long does a kettle take to boil
- If you keep pumping heat energy into the bottom of a kettle, sooner or later the water inside it will boil. 
^ A basic law of physics called the conservation of energy tells us that if you need to boil a liter of water, starting from the same temperature, you'll always have to add the same amount of energy to do it. 
^ Whether you use a camp fire or a kettle, a microwave or some amazing stirring device in the manner of James Prescott Joule, the amount of energy you have to put in to boil the water is exactly the same.

+ how does you know when to switch off
- all modern kettles switch themselves off automatically using thermostats (mechanical, electrical, or electronic devices that respond to changes in temperature).
^ The simplest ones are mechanical and use a bimetallic thermostat (described in our main article on thermostats) integrated into the element unit at the bottom of the kettle.
^ It consists of a disc of two different metals bonded tightly together, one of which expands faster than the other as the temperature rises.

^ The heating element in an electric kettle is connected to the thermostat and the thermostat has a variable resistor inside it, once the user sets the required temperature the thermostat controls the heating element accordingly. 
^ To be simple, if the user sets the temperature to high, then the thermostat resistor resistance would be less, therefore the heating element converts more electricity to heat. On the other hand, if a low temperature is set, the variable resistor resistance is high and the heating element will produce comparatively less heat. {topic=random}

^ If the user sets the temperature to high Power supply -> thermostat temperature set high -> transistor sends high current to heating element -> heating element produces a high amount of heat.

- Boiling water is my favourite thing to do 
^ Do you want to know how I boil water? {topic=boil}

- okay.That's fine. {topic=random}

+ [*]yes[*]
- Place the kettle under the tap pipe of the water container, taking care to align the tap spout and turn the pipe on to the right level to ensure the water flows properly. 
^ Do not spill cold water on the kettle, especially at the spigot.
^ Fill the kettle with cold water, make sure it is higher than the top of the heating tube, make sure you pay attention to this, put the lid on and plug it in, this is when the charging plug of the water heater shows red.
^ Look at the time when it starts to heat up, usually 12-15 minutes for a pot of water to boil.
^ After that a pot of water is ready! {topic=random}
